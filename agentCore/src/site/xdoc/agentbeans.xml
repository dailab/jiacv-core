		<section name="AgentBeans">
			<p>
				AgentBeans are components of an agent which encapsulate access to the agent's environment and other
				essential functionalities.
			</p>
			<p>
				The basic concepts of AgentBeans are implemented in the abstract class
				<a href="apidocs/de/dailab/jiactng/agentcore/AbstractAgentBean.html">
					<code>AbstractAgentBean</code>
				</a>
				and should be used wherever possible. These basic concepts include the lifecycle management and activity
				for AgentBeans. These two concepts are described in the following.
			</p>
			<subsection name="Lifecycle Handling in AgentBeans">
				<p>
					Like Nodes and Agents are subjected to the lifecycle (see
					<a href="overview.html#Agent%20Lifecycle">Agent Lifecycle</a>
					) so do the AgentBeans. There are several hook methods available in
					<a href="apidocs/de/dailab/jiactng/agentcore/AbstractAgentBean.html">
						<code>AbstractAgentBean</code>
					</a>
					which should be overridden if required. The purpose of these methods are listed below:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>doInit</b>
						<br />
						<p>
							Should contain initialisation code that ensures the functionality of the AgentBean. In
							this stage you should
							<b>avoid</b>
							the interaction with other AgentBeans as they might not have been initialised yet!
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>doStart</b>
						<br />
						<p>
							Code which activates the functionality of the AgentBean should be placed here.
							Interaction with other AgentBeans is possible.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>doStop</b>
						<br />
						<p>
							This method is called when the current AgentBean is due to be stopped. So code which
							deactivates the AgentBean's functionality should be placed here. Interaction with other
							AgentBeans is possible.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>doCleanup</b>
						<br />
						<p>
							Before being removed from the Agent this method gives the opportunity to free every
							resource acquired by and to finish all initiated processions of this AgentBean.
							Afterwards, the state of this AgentBean should be the same as before initialisation!
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<b>Note:</b>
					If you override some of the aforementioned hook methods, you
					<b>should</b>
					call the super methods in the appropriate order. This means you should invoke
					<code>super.doInit()</code>
					and
					<code>super.doStart()</code>
					<b>before</b>
					and
					<code>super.doStop()</code>
					and
					<code>super.doCleanup()</code>
					<b>after</b>
					your code!
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Activity in AgentBeans">
				<p>
					By default, each AgentBean is a passive one, meaning that it is only requested for action or
					knowledge procession. Nevertheless you have the possibility to declare your AgentBean active.
				</p>
				<p>
					AgentBean activated by defining the execution interval through the configuration or by calling
					<a href="apidocs/de/dailab/jiactng/agentcore/AbstractAgentBean.html#setExecutionInterval(int)">
						<code>setExecutionInterval(int)</code>
					</a>
					Active AgentBeans should also override the
					<a href="apidocs/de/dailab/jiactng/agentcore/AbstractAgentBean.html#execute()">
						<code>execute()</code>
					</a>
					which does nothing by default.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Note:</b>
					Currently two implementations of
					<a href="apidocs/de/dailab/jiactng/agentcore/execution/IExecutionCycle.html">
						<code>IExecutionCycle</code>
					</a>
					are available. The 
					<a href="apidocs/de/dailab/jiactng/agentcore/execution/SimpleExecutionCycle.html">
						<code>SimpleExecutionCycle</code>
					</a>
					schedules the action procession and the invocation of the <code>execute</code>
					methods in a pipelining fashion. This means, that actions and executions that take very long will
					delay all other computations within the same agent. You may look into the sources of
					<a href="apidocs/de/dailab/jiactng/agentcore/execution/SimpleExecutionCycle.html">
						<code>SimpleExecutionCycle</code>
					</a>
					to get an idea of how this simple implementation works. A more sophisticated realisation of the
					interface is the 
					<a href="apidocs/de/dailab/jiactng/agentcore/execution/NonBlockingExecutionCycle.html">
						<code>NonBlockingExecutionCycle</code>
					</a>
					which invokes the action procession and <code>execute</code> methods in own threads
					using the thread pool of the agent node. This means, that actions and executions
					are allowed to invoke other actions synchronously or to wait for events, because they 
					will not delay other computations within the agent.
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Pre-defined Spring Configurations">
				<p>
				There are Spring Bean definitions for the SimpleExecutionCycle and a SimpleAgent available. Please check
				<code>de.dailab.jiactng.agentcore.conf.Agent.xml</code> for further details.
